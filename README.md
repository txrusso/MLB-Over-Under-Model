## 🚀 Overview

Built a machine learning pipeline to predict MLB game totals and evaluate whether models can outperform sportsbook over/under lines.

Focus: **prediction accuracy vs real-world betting profitability**

---

## ⚡ Key Results

- Best model: **XGBoost**
- Lowest error: **MAE = 0.616**
- Best betting strategy (optimized threshold):
  - ROI: **-0.51%**
  - Win Rate: **53.97%**
  - Bets placed: **63**

👉 Even with a **>53% win rate**, the model is **not profitable**

---

## 🧠 Models Used

- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest (nonlinear baseline)
- XGBoost (tuned)
- XGBoost + Feature Selection

---

## 📈 Key Insight

> Improving prediction accuracy does **not** translate to betting profitability.

- Sportsbook odds require >50% accuracy to break even  
- Models approximated Vegas lines well  
- But **no model produced consistent positive ROI**
